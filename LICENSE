GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the
terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License,
supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions.

As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License, other
than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided by
the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a
subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an
interface provided by the Library.

A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with
which the Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked Version”.

The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying Modified Versions.

If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or
data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its
purpose remains meaningful, or b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the
additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.

3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a
header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code
under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material
is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and
accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer
lines in length), you do both of the following:

a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License. b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL
and this license document.

4. Combined Works.

You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken
together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of
the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for
debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:

a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License. b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL
and this license document. c) For a Combined Work that displays
copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the
Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user
to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document. d) Do one of the
following: 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of
this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable
for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the
Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a
modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU
GPL for conveying Corresponding Source. 1) Use a suitable shared library
mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that
(a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's
computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version. e)
Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be
required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and
only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and
execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining
or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked
Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must
accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for
conveying Corresponding Source.)

5. Combined Libraries.

You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
side by side in a single library together with other library facilities
that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and
convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do
both of the following:

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on
the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed
under the terms of this License. b) Give prominent notice with the
combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and
explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same
work.

6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as
you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU
Lesser General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you
have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that
published version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version
number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any
version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the
Free Software Foundation.

If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.
